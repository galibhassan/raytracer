# `<divPixel>` Raytracer
This is an HTML `<div>` based raytracer that I have been building in my free time. The image is rendered by coloring the plane old `<div>`s arranged in 2D array. 

I have also added an `.obj` loader. However the surface calculation seems to be betraying (see the last image downstairs).
